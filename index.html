                I explore how systems fail quietly — not because of bugs, but because of missing follow-ups,
                unclear ownership, and fragile assumptions. My work sits at the intersection of software,
                operations, and thoughtful system design.

            <p>
                I’m currently exploring early ideas around reconciliation and follow-up tooling for B2B
                workflows — with a focus on reducing operational leakage and manual overhead.
