        <p>
            At one point, our operational workflows were a jigsaw puzzle of tooling: Coda for ad hoc tables,
            SQL queries scattered across environments, CSV exports passed around via Teams, and a handful
            of API calls that were honestly more brittle than helpful.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each of these pieces worked in isolation, but collectively they didn’t. When asked a simple
            question like “what’s the real state of this customer today?”, the answer was often a guess —
            or a slow process that touched multiple systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            We knew what needed to happen. Customers had states, configurations, and metadata — but we
            lacked a reliable way to query all of it together.
        </p>

        <p>
            That changed when we consolidated most of our datasets into Databricks using delta tables.
            Customer data, configuration tables, and logs now lived in a single system designed for
            consistency, performance, and scale.
        </p>

        <p>
            Two benefits became immediately clear.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, we gained consistent access to a single source of truth. We stopped juggling exports,
            copying files, and reconciling mismatched datasets. Delta tables gave us a canonical way to
            query what actually exists.
        </p>

        <p>
            Second, we gained flexibility without sacrificing performance. Instead of stitching together
            dashboards fed by separate pipelines, we could run unified queries that answered real
            operational questions in seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
            The impact went beyond speed. What used to be a collection of semi-trusted artifacts became
            a dependable foundation for dashboards, automated jobs, and decision-making. We stopped
            asking “Is this right?” and started asking “What does this tell us?”
        </p>

        <p>
            From a systems perspective, this shift — from fragmented truth to unified state — reduced
            cognitive load, eliminated hidden discrepancies, and increased confidence across teams.
        </p>

        <p>
            The tooling changed, but more importantly, the model changed. We moved from wrestling
            multiple realities to querying a single, reliable one.
