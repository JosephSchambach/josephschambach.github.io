            When most engineers hear “reconciliation,” they think of code that compares two datasets and
            reports differences. In practice, reconciliation is neither a feature nor a script — it is
            a system property.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every process has expectations. A customer should have this document, that status, these
            permissions. But most systems only record what exists, not what should exist.
        </p>

        <p>
            That distinction matters. A system that can’t define its own expectations has no way of
            recognizing incompleteness.
        </p>

        <p>
            The consequences show up everywhere: CSV exports that silently drop rows, dashboards that
            never flag missing data, workflows that assume success unless explicitly told otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
            In each case, the system isn’t broken — it’s blind.
        </p>

        <p>
            Real reconciliation requires three things.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, an explicit model of expected state. Not what might exist, but what should exist.
        </p>

        <p>
            Second, a reliable representation of actual state. Not approximations or inferred signals.
        </p>

        <p>
            Third, a mechanism for closing loops. Visibility without action is just noise.
        </p>

        <p>
            Teams avoid reconciliation not because it’s hard, but because they assume missing issues
            will be noticed organically. That assumption holds only when systems are small and complexity
            is limited.
        </p>

        <p>
            As systems scale, the cost of unknowns grows: silent failures, untracked exceptions, and
            widening gaps between perceived and actual state.
        </p>

        <p>
            Reconciliation isn’t something you add to a backlog. It’s the act of designing a system
            that can admit incompleteness — and respond to it.
